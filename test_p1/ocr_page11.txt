parameter R/c;. It is also expected that sound scattering
also modifies the real part of k?, which again raises the
issue of a correct expression for the latter. However, it
may be conjectured that, in the low frequency range stud-
ied here, the power loss by sound scattering is much lower
than the one produced by viscous dissipation, because, as
for thermal effects, sound radiation occurs mainly in the
vicinity of the collapse. Thus we expect that the model in
its present form catches the main dissipation phenomenon
and that the values proposed for S(k?%) is a good estima-
tion. This will be examined in more details in future work.

The occurrence of traveling waves, aside of the issue
of the Bjerknes forces examined in the companion paper,
may also have fundamental consequences on the final stage
of the bubbles collapse. Indeed, it has been shown recently
that bubbles in traveling waves are more exposed to shape
instabilities and can undergo jetting, which reduces the fi-
nal collapse temperature 64], compared to a spherically
collapsing bubble. This would therefore influence the esti-
mation of the heat lost by a single bubble, but the spherical
collapse model used in the present study yields an upper
value.

Besides, measurements of the acoustic field in conical
structures has revealed the presence of a time-independent
mean pressure field, which amplitude may be comparable
with the first-harmonic part 36]. Our model does not
catch this feature, and there is yet no correct theoreti-
cal description of this phenomenon. We emphasize how-
ever that our derivation of the imaginary part of the wave
number is valid even in this case, since our decomposition
of the field Eq. accounts a priori for the presence of
such a mean field. This suggests that the present model
could be supplemented by a specific equation describing
this mean pressure field, which remains to be determined.

To conclude, we believe that the present model opens
the way to more realistic simulations of the coupled evo-
lution of the cavitation field and the acoustic field. The
nonlinear Helmholtz equation is relatively easy to solve
and constitutes a viable solution halfway between a fully
nonlinear simulation of the Caflish equations, which re-
quires painful, if not intractable, temporal integration, and
a fully linearized model which, as shown above, yields un-
realistic acoustic pressure values. The companion paper
