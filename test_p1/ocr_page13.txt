List of Figures
1 Dimensionless power dissipated by an ar-
gon bubble of ambient radius Ry = 3 um
in water, at 20 kHz: by viscosity II [thick
solid line, from Eq. (I3)]; by thermal diffu-
sion, ITY, [thick dashed line, from Eq ([12)].
The thin lines are the corresponding values
obtained from linear theory, Eqs. (15)-(16)
(solid: II? |. ; dashed: IIf} ;;,)- The ver-
tical dash-dotted line represents the Blake
threshold calculated by Eq. (6) . . . . . . .
2 Same as Fig.[Qlfor a 8 ym bubble. . . . . .
3 Same as Figs. [Il and [2] but varying Ry for
P* = 1.5. The vertical dash-dotted line rep-
resents the Blake threshold. . . . . . . . .. &
4 Real part (dashed) and imaginary part (solid)
of the wave number k. The thin horizontal
lines are predictions from linear theory
and the thick lines are results calculated
from Eqs. (33), (85). The vertical dash-
dotted line represents the Blake threshold. . E
5 Peak value of the dimensionless pressure field,
calculated by solving numerically Eq.
for various emitter displacement amplitudes.
Solid line: Uy = 5 pum; dashed line: Uy =
0.5 um; dash-dotted line: Uy = 0.2 pm. . . [9
6 Wave profiles for an amplitude of the emit-
ter of 5 um. Thick solid curve: predicted by
the present model (same as the thick solid
curve of Fig. [5); thin solid curve: obtained
by the linear dispersion relation Eq. (21);
thin dashed curve: obtained in the pure lig-
7 Phase between pressure and pressure gradi-
ent in the same conditions as Fig. [5] The
line-styles are the same as for Fig.[5] . . . .
8 Phase of the complex wave number k di-
vided by mr, in the same conditions as Fig.[5]
for Uy = 5 pum (solid line) Uy = 0.5 um
(dashed line), and Uy = 0.2 pm (dashed-
dotted line). For the largest amplitude, the
wave number near the emitter is seen to ap-
proach â€”m/4, as expected from Eq. (38). . .
